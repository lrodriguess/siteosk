          <p>Oskar Metsavaht is a multidisciplinary creator who treads through areas such as fashion, audio-visual, furniture design, socio-environmental activity, and expeditions.</p>
          <p class="tx_mn">"My creative process begins with a scene, a story, a style, a concept that I create from something that I wished for or lived. From this point on, I create the mood, the atmosphere, the looks, and the attitude. Most of the time, I conceive the campaign even before the collection. Maybe that is why I love doing the art direction of the photo shooting. I create the atmosphere of the story and I make my own films, through which I can share the scene I imagined in the beginning of the process. The pieces are designed to be the costume of my film. And it is possible to 'watch it' in every detail of the collection. I am only satisfied when the proposed elements for each piece, the colors, the textures, and the shapes are worn by the characters of the film I created."</p>

          <p class="tx_mn">His lifestyle connected to the urban, the nature, the arts, and the boarding sports, united with his constant need of experimentation, lead him to also develop projects such as the snowboard expedition trilogy Surfing the Mountains. As his ideas and projects are always interconnected and influence one another mutually, the trilogy served as inspiration for collections and documentaries directed by Oskar Metsavaht.</p>
          <p class="tx_mn">Through Om.art, his creation office, where he exercises new developments of his ideas, invitations came to create projects to national and international clients, such as the Andy Warhol Foundation of Art, Jeep Cherokee's special edition for Chrysler Brazil, the watch series for H.Stern entitled Arpoador, commercialized in Brazil and abroad, besides the creation of the Ipanema RJ sandals, a line inspired in the more authentic contemporary 'carioca' lifestyle.</p>
